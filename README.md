- Hi, my name is Simon, a senior in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying Computer Systems Engineering. 

I'm interested in working a collaborative project with others (could be anything code related). Please feel free to reach out. I have a background in C++ and Python, in which I have used to work on a variety of projects such as dynamically allocated connect four that expands based on user input and even a movie catalog lookup using a hashtable.
